Welcome to iOS Club! iOS Club (Beijing Information Science & Technology University Apple Club) is a cross-disciplinary and extracurricular community for Apple enthusiasts, dedicated to cultivating outstanding Apple product developers and designers. iOS Club consists of three major teams: â€‹Development, â€‹Design, and â€‹Operations, focusing respectively on iOS app development, UI design, social media management, and event organization. At the same time, we rely on competitions such as the â€‹China College Computer Competition - Mobile Application Innovation Contest and â€‹Apple WWDC Student Challenge to engage in learning exchanges and practical activities aimed at competition and entrepreneurship, broadening our members' horizons and enhancing their comprehensive abilities.

The club organizes learning in software development, industrial design, and product operations for Apple products such as â€‹iOS, â€‹macOS, â€‹watchOS, and â€‹tvOS. We apply the knowledge weâ€™ve learned outside of the classroom, helping members expand their horizons and improve their skills while fostering friendships through collaboration.

The club primarily conducts the following activities:

Regular training sessions in development, design, and operations.
Organizing exchange activities with Apple Inc.
Participating in the â€‹China College Computer Competition - Mobile Application Innovation Contest.
Inviting experts from leading domestic and international companies to share their insights with members.
